ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Welcome to q4quant.blog! I'm a student currently studying financial mathematics with the goal of becoming a quant. 

I'm a big fan of the Feynman techniqueâ€”if you can't explain something clearly, you probably don't understand it well.

  <em>"If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasnâ€™t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it."</em>

This blog is my way of sharpening my understanding and offering simpler explanations of quantitative finance for anyone else who finds existing resources too complicated.


This will be soon published to somewhere else instead of a markdown format here. </br>
Thanks for checking out, feel free to connect with me!
